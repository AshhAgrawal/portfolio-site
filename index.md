Hey there! :wave:

I'm Ashutosh Agrawal, a passionate Computer Scientist, AI/ML enthusiast, and a Master's student at New York University.

With a strong background in AI/ML, Generative AI, and Full-Stack Development, I'm currently working as a Research Assistant at NYU where I'm building AI trading agents and ML models. Previously, I've worked as an AI Intern at STL Digital and as a Senior Software Engineer at LTIMindtree (Disney & CitiBank), where I've architected cloud-native solutions, built agentic AI systems, and optimized large-scale data pipelines.

I'm excited to share my experiences, insights, and explorations here!

## Current Role
- **Research Assistant at NYU** (Jan 2025 - Present) - Designing AI trading agents using LangChain and Llama 3-Instruct, building ML/DL models with 92% prediction accuracy

## Here are a few things I have worked on...

- [AI Trading Agent]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#ai-trading-agent) - Designed an AI trading agent using LangChain and Llama 3-Instruct to automate screening, ranking, and backtesting undervalued stocks, integrating reinforcement learning for adaptive investment decisions. Achieved 92% prediction accuracy on 60+ years of financial data. [[Read More]]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#ai-trading-agent)

- [Agentic AI Resume Intelligence System]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#resume-intelligence-system) - Built an Agentic AI Resume Intelligence System (Llama 3-70B / GPT-4 + LangChain) to parse and match resumes to JDs, automating screening and boosting hiring accuracy by 90%. Engineered LangGraph + FastAPI multi-agent workflows with FAISS retrieval. [[Read More]]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#resume-intelligence-system)

- [CodeSensei – Autonomous Code Reviewer]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#codesensei) - Developed CodeSensei, an autonomous code-review agent using GPT-4 and AST parsing to detect logic flaws and propose optimized patches, reducing manual review effort by 55%. [[Read More]]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#codesensei)

- [Yuka Food & Cosmetic Scanner]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/#yuka-scanner) - Built an Agentic AI layer over Yuka using RAG, vector search, and GPT-4 to autonomously analyze ingredients and suggest safer alternatives, reducing manual lookups by 65%.
